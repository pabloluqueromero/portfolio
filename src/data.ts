Hi, my name is Pablo. After successfully completing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I am now pursuing a Masters in Artificial Intelligence Research while I work as a Software Engineer.
Although I have only been working for a year, I have worked in Agile teams, built web services (REST & SOAP), created batch processes, worked with a cloud-based application (AWS) and many more...
<br/>
<br/>
As a kid I moved  abroad and spent 6 years studying, training and living in different countries for which I can speak 4 languages fluently (and a bit of German). I would define myself as a very open-minded person with a great ability to solve problems and, most importantly, with great curiosity (especially when it comes to technologies and algorithms).
<br/>
<br/>
During my Bachelor's degree I specialised in Artificial Intelligence, focusing on algorithms designs, Machine Learning, Metaheuristics, Knowledge-based Systems among others. For my
<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/pabloluqueromero/TFG" class="paragraph-link" >bachelor's degree final degree project</a> I studied, proposed and coded algorithms to automate feature engineering for the construction of logical features.
