export const about: string = `
Hi, my name is Pablo. As a kid I moved  abroad and spent 6 years studying, training and living in different countries for which I can speak 4 languages fluently (and a bit of German).
<br/>
<br/>
After studying graduating from a Computer Science degree in 2021, I am now pursuing a Masters in Artificial Intelligence Research while I work as a Software Engineer.
Although I have only been working for a year  I have worked in Agile teams, building web services (REST & SOAP), batch processes, AWS and many more... 
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="#bachelorproject" class="paragraph-link" >bachelor's final degree project</a> I studied and propose algorithms to automate feature engineering for the construction of logical features. I am familiar  with the most common Machine Learning libraries and I am currently studying Hadoop!
